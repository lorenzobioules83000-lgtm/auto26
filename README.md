# AutoDrive Booking (frontend only)

This is a frontend-only React + Vite + Tailwind project (no backend).

## Setup

1. Unzip into a folder, for example `C:\Users\Lorenzo\Documents\auto-drive-booking`
2. Open CMD in that folder
3. Run:
   ```cmd
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:5173

## Notes
- Address lookup uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim (for dev/testing).
- Payment is simulated. You can later add Stripe for real payments.
